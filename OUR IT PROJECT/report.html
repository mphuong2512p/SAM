<h1>III) Project Description</h1>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<h3>Topic</h3>

<p>Due to the increased demand for a new technology that can completely solve many compulsory subjects in school, for instance, Math or Physics, only by scanning, entering files with those problems or even finishing this stage vocally. Furthermore, due to the inability to provide accurate and quick answers in the current existing applications. We aim to develop a single app to assist students with their academic work.</p>

<p>This project aims to develop cutting-edge technology that will only be used by Vietnamese high school students, such as a mobile phone app or other high-tech devices. This application uses the latest technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI). The end result will include a full justification for every response and every question on every topic taught in high school.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>Our distinct high school educational experiences served as our inspiration for working on this project. We found that the latest version of AI-based learning tools, such as QANDA, Dicamon, and PhotoMath, do not allow us the flexibility to enter the questions. Additionally, the algorithms used in those programs only look for previously solved answers and a propensity to interpret input questions incorrectly. Additionally, we examine, evaluate, and then apply into our invention some modern IT trends, particularly integrated AI-assistant features to answer, help with foreign language subjects, and Intelligent Recommendation will offer personalized solutions based on the users' strengths, preferences, and potential improvement areas[1]. Finally, we think that not only pupils but also individuals in need may find our website valuable. Developing the website will require a wide range of skills: web programming, collecting user experience, soft skills, project management and collaboration. The concept of AI-based learning is not new, but our solution will be the most thorough and sophisticated AI-based learning currently on the market to attract potential employers.</p>

<h3>Landscape</h3>

<p>Since this concept has been extremely popular due to the advance in artificial intelligence, we acknowledge that several problems will occur when we choose and develop it. Several significant rivals: QANDA (<a href="https://qanda.ai/vi">https://qanda.ai/vi</a>)[2], Dicamon (<a href="https://dicamon.vn">https://dicamon.vn</a>)[3], PhotoMath (<a href="https://photomath.com/en">https://photomath.com/en</a>)[4] have created products that are comparable to ours. The QANDA website, developed by Mathpresso Inc., served as the most intelligent to scan math problems and provide detailed solutions. In a similar way, the websites for Dicamon and PhotoMath use the same methods that use optical character recognition to answer the questions. These websites provide numerous options for a single question so that students can select the most appropriate ones as they help students in their educational path. After examining the competitors' advantages: offer a mobile application, a user-friendly interface, and a large answer database. Our main objective is to create an AI assistant to help students in grades 10, 11, and 12. The website will provide consumers a variety of features and functions while upholding a user-friendly interface and designs as a result of our virtual assistant's logical and imaginative training. This has made the project created by our team stand out from the competition in the market.</p>

<h2>2. Detailed Description</h2>

<h3>a. Aims</h3>

<p>In recent years, learning has gotten more challenging and competitive, while technology has advanced and improved. Since then, there has been an increase in demand from students for educational answer tools that would be integrated into computers and smartphones. Additionally, the AI-based learning systems that are currently accessible are unable to fully resolve and provide a clear explanation. After fully comprehending user requirements, our goal is to develop new AI-based learning with the most advanced capabilities. Hence, there would be a potential for our team to develop a new technology that will be the most advanced and comprehensive aid for Vietnamese pupils.</p>

<p>In order to compete with other platforms, we first conducted a poll on people's opinions of AI-based learning to identify the applications' shortcomings. This approach has produced outcomes with a wide range of user viewpoints; some features require improvement or full resolution. Two of our standout features are the AI assistant and the thorough explanation. Students will benefit from having adequate preparation before any test or exam. Our application also allows users to enter questions using any format they like, including text, scanning, photos, or voice. The users will save time and effort. As a result of this, our application may confidently compete consistently with other platforms.</p>

<p>After the planning phase, we decided to collect data and consult with the seniors about the viability. This is the most important stage that we need to go over. We have to divide our task among three people in order to research related techniques and schedule a consultation with our guidance. The development of the application demo on the GitHub repository then begins. We believe that the earlier a project is started, the more issues will be resolved quickly.</p>

<p>The User Interface's final objective is to smoothly satisfy users' needs, provide a multi-functional interface, help users understand the entire website, and perform other technical tasks. Due to the fact that it is essential to any application's success. Sketch, wireframe, mockup, and prototype are the four processes we will take to create the interface in order to showcase a well-designed application.</p>

<h3>b. Plans and Progress</h3>

<p><strong>Stage 1: Ideas initiation</strong></p>

<p>In the beginning, Quoc Huy considered a new technology that would work with AI assistants, using ChatGPT as an illustration. Due to the advancement in AI areas, he believes it would be fascinating to develop a new application using AI. Huy's concept was deemed to be extremely inventive and IT-related by the rest of the group. Minh Phuong offered unique suggestions for educational software. Due to the member learning experiences with the existing application, Thuy Vy came up with the idea that an AI-learning-based system can properly handle students' inquiries. The following day, everyone gathered and began formulating ideas for their tasks, and talked about our project's overall strategy. IYP is still debating project names, which should relate to Software Programs, Students, and Artificial Intelligence. After much deliberation, we chose to call the project as Student AI Mentor (SAM).</p>

<p><strong>Stage 2: Idea generation and development</strong></p>

<p>In the next step, we come up with concepts, and highlight the main characteristics and features of the website. We took great care when designing the user homepage, paying special attention to how quickly and easily users could download and use our website. Following that, we established the specific main components


        <p>  According to the aforementioned timeline, the Student AI Mentor mock-up we created only included five main features: Home, About SAM, Grades, Download, and Account. Make the website's Home page the main landing page. This section's categories include an IN YOUR POCKET's introduction, inspiration, and mission. To further divide each application category, our team further divides the Categories segment into subsections. About SAM, Grades, Download, and Account are some of these subsections. In the ABOUT SAM features, there are certain unique characteristics. This serves as instruction for our SAM assistance and demonstrates its role and expertise. Before installing SAM, users can test it.
        </p>

        <h3>Grades Section</h3>
        <p>
            The Grades part is a section that focuses on Grades 10, 11, and 12, particularly thirteen topics in high school in Vietnam. Detailed instructions for using the integrated SAM are also provided. This area will provide download information and links to the Appstore and Google Play for the Download section. The Account feature, which stores personal data, is the last.
        </p>

        <h3>Website Development Tools</h3>
        <p>
            Our team took its time selecting the website's development tools after the brainstorming session was over. Due to its functionality and effectiveness, we utilized the software “Visual Studio Code” to design and construct the website, but we still need to gain experience with it. As a result, we encountered design problems and could only recollect a few of the tool's intricate features. Despite their high effectiveness, other tools were not practical for our work.
        </p>
        <!-- Add other content and sections accordingly -->
    </div>
    <!-- Add other sections like Roles, Tools and Technologies, Testing, Timeframe, Risks, Group Processes and Communication -->

        <p>
           In order to maintain equity in the group, we decided not to vote for a leader. We discuss together to see what is coming up and what the next step is. We are all cooperative and constructive, so there are no conflicts in the team until present. Our team size of 3 is also perfect when it comes to harsh decisions and the need to vote for one of the solutions.
            However, due to the complexity of the project and the difference in abilities of members, each of us will have different tasks to do. Minh Phuong is nominated to be a Web Designer since she is the only spark in the team who has knowledge of HTML, CSS to build a website. Thuy Vy and Quoc Huy have a mission as Data Researchers, to collect data and send Minh Phuong regular updates about the project to build a proper promotion website. Furthermore, both of us will have to consider splitting the right phases for the team to work efficiently and finish before the deadline. The paperwork is also held by Vy and Huy in order to help Phuong fully concentrate on web development.
        </p>

        <h3>d. Scope and Limits</h3>
        <p>
            "There's no such thing as perfection. You're never finished with a film. You run out of time." -- Peter Jackson, director of 'The Lord of the Rings’ and ‘The Hobbit’ trilogies.
        </p>

        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>
            "Student AI Mentor (SAM)" application, which combines generative AI to solve exercises, should contain basic functions as a normal app with calculation tools, however, it will be enhanced by AI through its ability to “think” of possibilities of the current problems and deploy specific solutions. Furthermore, due to the high demand for solutions for other less popular subjects in schools, more tools are added to SAM, to have a variety of approaches than just typing in questions.
            ...
            <!-- Include the remaining content for the scope section -->
        </p>

        <h4>Limits</h4>
        <p>
            Due to the huge impact of generative AI on every aspect, we have to decide what we mean to solve. In my opinion, a good project is a project that can point out specific problems and specific solutions for only them. The harsh problem of developing a study application with generative AI, we have to ensure the quality of sessions and answers given to be the most accurate. Our team is not considered to be professional, so undergraduate students and above will not be put in our scope due to the fact that our team has a huge concern about the complexity and academics of subjects in universities...
            <!-- Include the remaining content for the limits section -->
        </p>

        <h3>e. Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            To provide users with a UI experience, we developed the front end of our website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Phuong has worked with HTML and CSS before, though. The remaining members of the team are unfamiliar with this language. As a result, Phuong offers to be in charge of developing the website and get exposed to JavaScript at the same time. Using GitHub, Huy and Vy, who are both in charge of administration and collaboration, share and track code for group projects...

        </p>

        <h3>f. Testing</h3>
        <p>
            We encountered some substantial obstacles when creating the SAM website. To identify the problems and shortcomings of our websites, we repeatedly tested them throughout the development process. We used empirical assessment to analyze and then implement new improvements in this project because it is quite large and complex. More testing phrases are undertaken as our product develops...

        <!-- Previous content... -->

        <h3>g. Timeframe</h3>
        <p>
            Since we are only at the early stages of the SAM project, we design a plan for project development, illustrated in the table below, in order to have a stable workflow.
        </p>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Phase</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Timeline</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Planning</td>
                <td>Project planning, requirements gathering, and team organization</td>
                <td>Month 1</td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Add more rows for each phase -->
        </table>

        <h3>h. Risks</h3>
        <p>
            Risks are inevitable in projects. Greater projects come with greater risks. By evaluating, we initially conclude the very first potential issues existing in developing a study assistant application that has AI integration will be classified and ranked specifically as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Technical Errors</h4>
                <p>
                    Technical errors, by means, are errors related to tools and technologies applied that may cause conflicts or incompatibility within the app structure. The types of technical errors are various and complex, so we have filtered a few popular and remarkable issues below. Over Budget is also classified as a technical issue, since there is unexpected expansion, cancellation, or replacement of tools and technologies being used in the project.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Team Conflicts</h4>
                <p>
                    It is also common that when team working, we can harshly avoid debates and disagreements among the workflow. Communication, Ideation, and Evaluation are 3 most competitive stages when it comes to teamwork. In fact, our team rarely has conflicts, however, risks are always there.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Risk Management Evaluation</h4>
        <p>
            Risk Evaluation Formula: Risk Score = Likelihood x Consequence
        </p>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Risk</th>
                <th>Likelihood</th>
                <th>Consequence</th>
                <th>Risk Score</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Technical Errors</td>
                <td>High</td>
                <td>High</td>
                <td>High</td>

        <h3>i. Group Processes and Communication</h3>
        <p>
            Communication methods:
            Early on, IN YOUR POCKET decides to share contact information. To share the meeting time and place, we establish various channels of communication group chat and use that platform as our primary tool. Use Google Meet as a forum for task discussion and address the challenges the team has solved while working on the project. We set our timetable to meet four times a week, with a face-to-face meeting on Wednesday and online meetings on the other days, depending on the schedules of the group members.
        </p>
        <p>
            Daily Updated Report and Announce Project Progress:
            Google Docs is picked as a tool to assist the group in storing and sharing essential documents and information. Each team member continuously updates their task and posts any updates on Facebook Messenger for the other team members to recognize the process is proceeding. A face-to-face meeting allows us to quickly help each other with their task problems and manage the workload. We need the task bond to ensure that jobs are completed to a high standard and by the draft deadline. Peer review will be used to evaluate each person's contribution to the group effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Workplace Management:
            Our team uses the GitHub repository to store and manage the programming files and research documents for this project. We made use of the online collaboration tool Google Docs to store our content as well as project drafts, brainstorming files, and other materials. As GitHub is only used to manage our coding files, Visual Code Studio is used instead for programming. But after that, we will upload it to GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
            Team Processes and Dynamics:
            To find an ultimate solution, each of us has the responsibility to announce everyone in the team whenever one has problems. In the scenario that a person is not able to finish their task before the deadline, that individual should update his/her current progress to the team and have a discussion on what to do next in order to keep the project on track. This helps everyone face less stress from the amount of work. Until now, our group has had no problem in communication. However, to have good preparation, everyone in the team can bypass one’s absence and take over the one’s task, and that person has to give rational reasons for absence afterwards, whenever he/she is unexpectedly off the grid.

        <h3>IV) Skills and Jobs</h3>
        <p>
            Due to the lack of employees working on it at the moment, it would be a tremendous change if venture capitalists granted us the option to extend this project. This would improve the precision and efficiency of the development process. Technical capabilities and soft skills make up the two sections of the hiring requirements. We are searching for dependable and skilled personnel to help us achieve our long-term business objective. The project should carry out the activities listed in this development plan, which include establishing an AI assistant, a three-month schedule, gathering data, and building the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our SAM project already has 4 positions in charge of Project Manager, Quality Tester and Technical Advisor. We maintain the consistency of the system and generate project ideas and technical functions. Technically speaking, we are looking for candidates for four positions: backend developers, a data analyst, and two software engineers.
        </p>

        <h4>Back-end Developer</h4>
        <p>
            The ability to build up the server and database structure, specifically choosing and configuring the right technological stack, is necessary for this position's members. Additionally, we are searching for someone in this role who has strengths in building API. The tasks listed below fall under the purview of a back-end developer:
        </p>

            <li>Have a solid understanding of performance requirements and objectives, to build high-efficient solutions.</li>
            <li>Create and manage application programming interfaces (APIs).</li>
            <li>Create storage and acceptance solutions for websites, especially those that process payments.</li>
            <li>Entails writing, testing, and maintaining development solutions for issues with code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A person with experience as a DevOps Engineer or Software Engineer is advantageous. We nevertheless appreciate ambitious members who have no fear of making errors and learn from them.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Analyst</h4>
        <p>
            In this project, we required an individual who has the ability to translate the raw data into logical insights. Ensuring the accuracy and quality of the core data. That will contribute to providing comprehensible illustrations for our users and stakeholders. The essential skills that we are looking for as a data analyst:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Correcting coding issues and other relevant issues, and removing corrupted data.</li>
            <li>Rearranging data in a legible way through the creation and upkeep of databases and data systems.</li>
            <li>Filter data by looking into reports and performance metrics to find and fix coding issues.</li>
            <li>The diagnosis and prognosis could benefit from using statistical methods to find, examine, and interpret patterns and trends in complex data sets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The ideal candidate will have good communication and presentation skills as well as proficiency with data analytic tools including R, Python, and SQL. This will eventually provide a strong rigor for the project.
        </p>

        <h4>Two AI Software Engineers</h4>
        <p>
            An employee who fills this role through recruiting is in charge of testing and qualifying as well as artificial intelligence (machine learning, deep learning). Two employees will be hired for this position in order to increase productivity and reduce workload strain. Due to the lack of experience and expertise on our team in developing AI-based learning products. An AI software engineer's primary responsibility in this project is to productize data science research so that it can benefit internal stakeholders or external clients. Additionally, an AI software engineer is in charge of keeping up with the possibilities for transferring our technology, a significant undertaking that includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build Infrastructure as Code</li>
            <li>Continuous Integration and Versioning Control</li>
            <li>Tests</li>
            <li>API Development</li>
            <li>Development of Pilots and MVP Applications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In general, we are searching for a highly skilled candidate with experience in the field of software engineering, problem-solving skills and a high tolerance for stress are also needed.
